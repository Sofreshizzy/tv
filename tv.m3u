# The Free2View Master Playlist Project! A Free and Legal IPTV List curated by The Frugal Streamer

# Note: To the best of my knowledge, all of these streams are legal streams, either over-the-air or live-streamed through unscrambled
# links over the internet. All links are not guaranteed to be stable, but tested before being added to this list. I do not 
# guarantee that these links will remain stable or active and any dead links could be removed at any time. Enjoy! -Georges B.
